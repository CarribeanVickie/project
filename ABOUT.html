        us by Jesus Christ who is the head of His church (Ephe 1:22; 5:23; Col 1:18):</p>

        <p>Every achievement or success is tied to the success of leadership.Leadership is cultured through training.</p>
        <p>Developing and establishing a strong, all round trained leadership is our key goal in our ministry focus.</p>
        <h1><i>Obeying</i> OUR CALL<br>as Believers in Jesus Christ</h1>
        <p>Before Jesus sent the twelve, he fed them and trained them three and a half years. He has commissioned us the Church to:</p>
        <h2>Feed the flock;</h2>
        <p>Productivity, future, prosperity and strength is a result of a a well fed and healthy flock. As Jesus
        admonished Apostle Peter to feed the flock; John 21:15-17 that becomes our commitment</p>
        <p>Before dealing with others, we are the priority; Mathew 7:3</p>
        <p>The strength, stability and durability of a building is as good as its foundation; Mathew 7:24-27</p>
        <h2>Influence the environment;</h2>
        <p>Once transformed you will not conform to the world but you will influence; Romans 12:1-2,</p>
        <p>We will light up the world around us and beyond once we are lighted up; Mathew 5:14</p>
        <p>We will bring divine taste affect all as the salt; Mathew 5:13</p>
        <h2>Reach out to the world;</h2>
        <p>In obedience to Jesusâ€™ commission we will keep engaged in outreach missions for the unreached; Mathew 28:18-20</p>
        <p>We shall remain engaged with the world as the sons of God eagerly awaited to be manifested; Romans 8:1</p>
        <p>The world will come calling; let us go to the house of the God of Israel and hear what He will tell us that we
        may obey him; Isaiah 2:3 ; Micah 4:2</p>
        <p>The word of God shall go forth from this house as the pillar and ground of truth; 1Timothy 3:15</p>
        <h2>Reach out to the body of Christ;</h2>
        <p>Have envisaged to establish a multisectoral facility which will serve as the training centre to reproduce
        focused and effective ministers through; teachings, trainings, equipping and empowering individuals to discover, develop,
        actualize and maximize the potential of their inherent gifts and purposes. 2Timothy 2:15</p>
